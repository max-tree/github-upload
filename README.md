# github-upload

NOTE to OIT folks:

For the Roman Numeral to Arabic and vice versa exam, the .exe and the three source files are all found together. The Rock, Paper, Scissors folder
is a different project.

I spent 3 hours and 40 minutes on the code for the exam and uploaded everything by the 4 hour mark.

I tested everything and it should work and be visible to you. Please let me know if you have any issues accessing my source code and .exe file.
